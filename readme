 1.Builtin Commands
    cd [directory]
       Change current working directory to a specified one.
    clear
       Clears the screen.

 2.Executable Files
    To run an executable from this shell, type the name of the executable and hit enter.
    An executable can be run in the background by adding the argument '&' after the path. The & must be separated by a space character.
----------------------------------
 3.Input/Output Redirection
    MyShell accepts i/o redirection commands.
    > [outputfile]   redirects output from the screen to [outputfile], replacing the existing file if it exists. Usable on internal commands dir, environ, echo, and help, and any executable files.
    >> [outputfile]  redirects output from the screen to [outputfile], appending to the existing file if it exists. Usable on internal commands dir, environ, echo, and help, and any executable files.
    < [inputfile]    redirects input from the keyboard to [inputfile]. Usable on any executable files.
----------------------------------
 4.Piping
    Multiple operations can be strung together using the pipe (|) operator. For example,
	 [program1] | [program2]
	will execute program1, then pass its output as the input to program2. This is the same as 
	 [program1] > somefile
	 [program2] < somefile
	Multiple commands can be piped together. The first command/executable must give some output, and the second command/executable must take input as a parameter.
